#### Feedback from client

Caleb was pleased with the functionality of the bot, saying that it “works really well”. He also commented about the trading system, mainly regarding the trading slots and notifications. “The trading slots were a nice addition to prevent people from being overwhelmed with requests when they return to their computers.”, Caleb said. He also said the notifications were great to inform people when they received a request, and the fact that they work both ways, informing the recipient of a trade request and the sender of an acceptance/denial of their sent trade request.

The lack of the three difficulties was a letdown, however Caleb stated that, after seeing the final product, he would want to see difficulties implemented in a different way from originally planned.

#### Recommendations for future improvements

##### Consumables:

These could be added to give the game more complexity, thus the player more options in how they want to run their farm. This could entail items such as fertilizer to increase crop yield one time, or a limited duration marketing campaign to increase how much money is earned from producing drinks.

##### Fluctuation in fruit prices

Caleb commented on how he would like to see difficulties implemented in a different way. One way this could be tackled is through the creation of a market, where the prices of drinks and fruits would fluctuate depending on the supply/demand of the respective item. As a result, the game would become more difficult, as players would be hurt by the decrease in selling prices if they did not adapt to capitalize off of the changing market.

##### Random events that either boost or hurt gameplay

Implementing random events would also add some variation to the gameplay. Players would need to engage with the upcoming events and in-game forecast to make decisions about what action they would need to take. Some of these random events could include a harvest moon which would increase harvest yield for a certain duration, or a drought which would hurt harvest yield. Appropriate in-game items would have to be added to allow players to react to these events. A forecast window would have to be created to let the players know approximately what event is coming up and when.
